      Doom will be a first-person shooter which has "badass demons, big effing guns,and moving really fast" as key principles, according to id Software executive 
producer Marty Stratton. The game will feature a large arsenal of weapons, 
which can be collected and freely switched by players throughout the game. 
Many classic weapons, including the super shotgun and BFG 9000, will make a 
return. In addition, melee weapons such as the chainsaw, which can cut enemies 
in half, are also featured.

      Many enemies from the original games like the 
Revenant, Mancubus, and Cyberdemon return as well, some of them redesigned.
 As the combat system of the game puts emphasis on momentum and speed, the game 
allows players to perform movements like sprinting and double-jumping. A combat 
system known as "push forward combat" is featured, which discourages players 
from taking cover behind obstacles or resting to regain health. As a result, 
the game will not feature any cover mechanics or a health-regeneration system. 
Players can collect health and armour pick-ups scattered throughout levels, or 
kill enemies to regain health. A new mechanic introduced in Doom is the melee 
execution system. It allows players to perform a melee-takedown when players 
deal enough damage to enemies. Enemies available for melee-takedown will be 
highlighted. id Software stated that Doom's campaign will be more than 13 
hours long.
