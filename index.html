    <p>Doom is a videogame that takes up a special place in my heart that can't be filled by other videogames. It is going to be rebooted and it was announced last week that it will be releasing this May on Friday the 13th. I wanted to create a service to provide people with information about the beta and other news about the videogame that gets released before May 13th. If you would like to be added to this list, please provide your email address below:</p>
